# Image Placeholders

This directory should contain:

- `silhouette.png` - Transparent PNG silhouette for Act I (1600px tall)
- `parchment.jpg` - Seamless dark parchment texture
- `skyline.svg` - Simple city skyline silhouette path

These images will be used in the portfolio animations. For now, the components use CSS gradients and shapes as placeholders.
