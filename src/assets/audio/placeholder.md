# Audio Placeholders

This directory should contain:

- `portfolio-sounds.mp3` - Audio sprite file containing:
  - `rumble` (0-8s) - Act I ambient loop
  - `city` (8-20s) - Act II city ambient loop  
  - `pen` (20-21s) - Act III pen writing sound
  - `hum` (21-29s) - Act IV blueprint hum loop
  - `seal` (29-29.6s) - Act V success seal sound

For now, the audio system is configured but will gracefully handle missing files.
